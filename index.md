# My Project Playground

Welcome! This is a personal space where I explore and learn by building small, self-contained projects. Each project below is organized into its own folder and is accessible via Github Pages. For information on how I did this, you can read [this blog post](https://blog.hakmal.com/).

## Projects

- [Responsible AI Licensing](projects/rail/)
  - A research project while with researchers from Lancaster University and MIT exploring a way for responsible AI licensing. A very early implementation of an idea made using Twine.

## üìù About This Repo

This is a sandbox-style GitHub repo intended for:

- Practicing programming skills
- Showcasing playful and quirky ideas
- Learning through experimentation
- Documenting small prototypes

Feel free to explore each folder!
